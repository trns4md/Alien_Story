    <h1>Get out of town</hi>

    <p> You are seriously freaked out, and you are somewhat of a coward, so you ditch everyone and run for your life.  
    However, karma has you in it's grasp, and you die in a car accident as you speed out of your community breaking all the traffic laws.  
    Rest in pieces schmuck!</p>
